    "\n",
    "- Textual data in Go uses UTF-8 encoding by default.\n",
    "- Encoding is a way to represent thousands of different\n",
    "- Code pages are tables which use the first few bytes of data to determine which page to use\n",
    "- Each symbol in the code page is called a code point\n",
    "\n",
    "> It is important to understand that on the pages of the code table there are no characters, but only their codes. The code table is a kind of dictionary that allows you to translate the code into a character and vice versa. So symbols are seen in terms of bytes, and bytes are seen in terms of symbols.\n",

    "## Runes\n",
    "\n",
    "- Text is represented using the rune type\n",
    "- Similar to `char` in many other languages\n",
    "- Rune is an alias for `int32`(32-bit integer)\n",
    "- Always a number: will print numeric value unless proper formatting is specified\n",
    "- A rune can represent any symbol\n",
    "  - Letters, numbers, punctuation, emoji, etc.\n",

    "## Strings Explained\n",
    "\n",
    "- String is the data type for storing multiple runes\n",
    "- Strings are just an array of bytes\n",
    "  - There is no null termination with a Go string\n",
    "- When iterating a string, iteration occurs over bytes\n",
    "  - Bytes are not symbols, they are just bytes\n",
    "  - Special iteration required to get runes/symbols\n"
