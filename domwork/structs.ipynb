    "\n",
    "- Structs allow data to be stored in groups\n",
    "  - Structs are similar to classes in other languages\n",
    "  - Each data point in the structure is called a field\n",
    "  - storing data in groups is more efficient\n",
    "- Possible to associate functionality with structures\n",
    "  - Helps organize code and data\n",

    "## Defining a struct\n",
    "\n",

    "    field string\n",

    "We use the `type` keyword to define a new type called `Sample`. The type is a struct. The struct has three fields: `field`, `x`, and `y`. The fields are of type `string`, `int`, and `int` respectively.\n",

    "## Instantiating a struct\n",
    "\n",

    "data := Sample{\"word\", 1, 2}\n",

    "\n",

    "## What is a `struct`?\n",
    "\n",
    "In Go, a struct is a composite data type that groups together variables(called fields) under a single name. These variables can be of different types, making structs very versatile for data modeling, Here's a breakdown of what a struct is and its characteristics in Go:\n",
    "\n",
    "## Definition and Characteristics\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Grouping of Fields**: Structs allow you to combine fields of possibly different types into a single entity. This is useful for modeling real-world entities or complex data structures.\n",
    "- **Type declaration**: A struct is declared with `struct` keyword, followed by a block of fields.\n",
    "- **Fields**: Each field in a struct has a name and a type, Fields can be of any type, including other structs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why use structs?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data Modeling**: Structs are ideal for creating more complex data types that represent real-world entities. For example, a `Person` struct can be used to represent a person, with fields like `name`, `age`, `gender`, etc.\n",
    "- **Organization**: They help in organizing and grouping related data together, making the code more readable and maintainable.\n",
    "- **Method Attachment**: In Go, methods can be attached to structs. This allows you to define behaviors related to the data the struct represents. For example, a `Person` struct can have a `GetAge()` method that returns the age of the person.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Basic Syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "```go\n",
    "type StructName struct {\n",
    "  Field1 FieldType1\n",
    "  Field2 FieldType2\n",
    "  // ... more fields\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "```go\n",
    "type Person struct {\n",
    "  Name, City String\n",
    "  Age int\n",
    "}\n",
